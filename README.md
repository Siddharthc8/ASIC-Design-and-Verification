Welcome to the ASIC Design and Testbench Repository! This repository contains a collection of Verilog and SystemVerilog design files, along with their respective testbenches. It also includes UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) testbenches for advanced verification needs.

The design files are located in the src folder. Their corresponding testbenches are in the sim folder, where each is named tb_ followed by the design name for easy identification.
