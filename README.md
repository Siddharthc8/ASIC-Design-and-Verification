Welcome to the ASIC Design and Testbench Repository! This repository contains a collection of Verilog and SystemVerilog design files, along with their respective testbenches. It also includes UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) testbenches for advanced verification needs.

The design files are in the "src" folder and their respective test-benches for whichever available will be under "sim" folder with "tb_" followed by the design name for easy identification.
